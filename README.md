GettingAndCleaningData_wk4_Assignment

The run_analysis.R contains all the steps involved in getting and cleaning the newset dataset as is stored in the newset.txt file.

To replicate the data cleaning process, just save the Script to your working directory and source it with 
source("run_analysis.R")

The script will first create a data file in your working directory and download the original data source in preparation for data cleaning later on.
